Notice how /usr/local starts with backslash ? There's root directory from which you can access other directories; the image to keep in mind is the root directory is where root starts, and everything else is branching form it

How to access the folder you need:

Method #1 : press CtrlL in the file manager ( which is called nautilus, by the way) and type /usr/local into the address bar or / .

Method#2: Pressing repeatedly AltArrow Up buttown in file manager will get you to root directory (which is like C:\ folder in windows), and navigate graphically to whatever folder you need from there.

Method #3: Press AltF2 to open "Run command" dialogue and type nautilus /usr/local
